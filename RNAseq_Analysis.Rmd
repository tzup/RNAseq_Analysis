# RNAseq Analysis

## Background

This tutorial outline an RNAseq analysis routine conducted in my R + Biocondcutor data analysis course (BIOS6660) using one of my collaborator's data set, Dr. Eric Schmidt.  Since RNAseq dataset is typically very large, we extracted only Chromosome 19 to ease perform the analysis on local computer (mostly laptops)

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
